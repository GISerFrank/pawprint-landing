      "paragraph1": "PawPrint was born when David's cat Potato turned 8 and started showing signs of chronic health conditions. As pet parents ourselves, we experienced firsthand the challenges of keeping track of vet appointments, medications, and health records for our aging furry friends.",
      "paragraph2": "We realized that while technology had transformed so many aspects of our lives, pet care was still stuck in the past — scattered notes, forgotten appointments, and guesswork about our pets' health.",
      "paragraph3": "Today, Frank and his cat Lilwhite, along with David and Potato, are building PawPrint to help pet parents stay on top of their pets' health with AI-powered insights, smart reminders, and a supportive community. We're just getting started on our mission to make pet care smarter and more intuitive for everyone.",
